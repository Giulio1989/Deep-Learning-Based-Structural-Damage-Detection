# Deep_Learning_based_Structural_Damage_Detection
Stuctural damage identification and localization using convolutional neural networks

1. Proposed a damage identification and localization technique for masonry structures using convolutional neural networks (based on AlexNet and GoogleNet using Caffe and Tensorflow).

2. Applied region-based convolutional neural networks (Faster-RCNN) to damage detection for masonry structures.
