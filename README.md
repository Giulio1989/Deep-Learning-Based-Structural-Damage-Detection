## Project Summary

1. Developed a damage identification and localization technique for civil structures using convolutional neural networks (based on LeNet-5, AlexNet-8, ZFNet-8, and GoogLeNet(inception v1)-22).

2. Applied region-based convolutional neural networks (Faster-RCNN) to damage detection in real-time.
