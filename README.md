## Project Summary

1. Proposed a damage identification and localization technique for masonry structures using convolutional neural networks (based on AlexNet-8 and GoogLeNet-22 using Caffe).

2. Applied region-based convolutional neural networks (Faster-RCNN) to damage detection for masonry structures.
